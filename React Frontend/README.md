# Technical Challenge IPS Health and Wellness

This application is a simple marketplace simulation with an intergrated DB.

This can also be used with faux'd data for the sake of quick testing, or simply running the frontend alone for dev purposes.

### For initial set up of the front end, simply run
>npm install.
npm start will start the React-based frontend.

If the database is live, the application will work as expected from here.

### To run the application without the DB for testing, or dev, simply run:
> npm run test

Then, in another terminal, run:
> node server.js

This will work as a very simple emulation of a dev environment, allowing front end developers to work without the backend.
This is not a very extensive feature due to time constraints.
